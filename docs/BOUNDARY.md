# Service boundary — `apps/web` ↔ `apps/api`

Status: **active** · Owner: backend integration · Last updated: 2026-05-24

This document defines the responsibility split between the Next.js app
(`apps/web`) and the NestJS Jubelio integration service (`apps/api`) in the
Elorae monorepo. It is the source of truth for *who writes what* and *how the
two services talk*. Any PR that violates the rules below must either update
this document or be rejected.

## 1. Principle

- `apps/web` owns ERP business logic and UI.
- `apps/api` owns Jubelio integration: HTTP client, token lifecycle, push,
  ingest, webhook receivers, queues, long-running jobs.
- Each table has one **write owner**. Other service may read via the shared
  Prisma client in `@elorae/db`.

### Decision rule

> "Does this code talk to Jubelio (push, pull, webhook, or background job
> related to a Jubelio resource)?"
>
> - **Yes** → `apps/api`
> - **No** → `apps/web`

**Exception — ERP triggers with Jubelio side-effects.** Actions like
`receiveFG`, `createGRN`, `createStockAdjustment` stay in `apps/web` and write
to the local DB. In the same Prisma transaction they append a row to
`JubelioOutbox`. The `apps/api` outbox worker drains it. The ERP action does
not call Jubelio directly. **⏳ planned.**

## 3. Data ownership

**Write owner** is the service authorised to issue `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`
on the table. Reads are unrestricted via `@elorae/db`.

Tables marked ⏳ do not exist in Prisma schema yet — listed here as the target
contract for the migrations that will introduce them.

| Table                          | Owner                       | Reads from other            | State |

### 3.1 Stock writes — two writers (⏳ planned)

- **web** writes `InventoryValue` and `StockAdjustment` when an ERP action
  triggers (`receiveFG`, `createGRN`, `createStockAdjustment`,
  manual adjustment). Same transaction inserts `JubelioOutbox` row of type
  `stock-adjustment.push`.
- **api** writes `InventoryValue` and `StockAdjustment` when the Jubelio
  `stock` webhook arrives (external mutation in Jubelio).

Both writes go through a shared helper in `@elorae/db` to enforce the columns:
`source ('ERP' | 'JUBELIO_WEBHOOK')`, `externalRef`, `idempotencyKey`.

### 3.2 Sales writes — two writers (⏳ planned)

- **api** creates `SalesOrder` rows from Jubelio (ingest endpoint or webhook
  `salesorder`). It owns Jubelio-mirrored fields: marketplace metadata, AWB,
  Jubelio status.
- **web** updates `SalesOrder` only for fields it owns: internal status,
  picking notes, fulfillment user. When a web-owned change must mirror back to
  Jubelio (e.g. mark-as-complete), web inserts a `JubelioOutbox` row.

Field-level ownership is enforced by Prisma client middleware in
`@elorae/db/sales-order-guard.ts`.

## 4. Communication patterns

### 4.1 `web → api` (sync, low-volume) — ⏳ planned

User-facing flows where api must respond inline.

- Use cases: "Push catalog now" button, fetch WMS list for UI, fetch Jubelio
  token state, manual sync trigger.
- Auth: NextAuth JWT in cookie → forwarded by web server action as
  `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` → Nest verifies with shared `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`.
- Latency budget: 200 ms guard at gateway. Errors surfaced to user.

**Current state:** api endpoints `/jubelio/status` and `/jubelio/refresh` exist
but are unguarded (any caller can hit them). Auth bridge to apps/web NextAuth
JWT is pending.

### 4.2 `web → api` (async, write-coupled via outbox) — ⏳ planned

ERP action commits local write **and** `JubelioOutbox` row in one Prisma
transaction. api outbox worker (BullMQ + Upstash Redis) drains:

```
loop every N seconds:
  rows = SELECT * FROM JubelioOutbox WHERE status='PENDING' ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 50
  for each row:
    try: call Jubelio
    on success: row.status='DONE', row.completedAt=now
    on failure: row.attempts++, row.lastError=...,
                row.status='FAILED' (retried) or 'DEAD_LETTER' (if attempts >= max)
                next retry delayed by exponential backoff
```

- **Idempotency key:** `${entityType}:${entityId}:${version}` — Jubelio call
  must accept this key (or be naturally idempotent).
- **No sync HTTP call** from a Prisma transaction. Always outbox.

### 4.3 `api → web` (rare) — ⏳ planned

Only for cache invalidation:
- `POST /api/internal/revalidate` with `{ paths: string[] }`.
- Auth: shared `INTERNAL_API_KEY` header (env), **not** user JWT.

Avoid otherwise. Prefer api owning its own data and web fetching from api.

### 4.4 Jubelio → api (webhooks) — ⏳ planned

- Path: `POST /webhooks/jubelio/:event` (events: `salesorder`, `stock`,
  `salesreturn`, `product`).
- Verify Jubelio signature header `webhook-signature`:
  `sha256(JSON.stringify(rawBody) + WEBHOOK_SECRET)` (per Jubelio docs — not
  strict HMAC).
- Persist raw payload to `JubelioWebhookEvent` table, ack 200 immediately,
  process asynchronously via BullMQ queue.
- Idempotency: dedupe by Jubelio's `event_id` (or hash of payload if missing).
- Jubelio retries non-200 responses up to 3 times — return 200 quickly even
  when payload processing is deferred to the queue.

## 5. Auth model

| Endpoint type           | Mechanism                                              | State |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | :---: |
| api: user-facing        | NextAuth JWT (shared secret) + RBAC guard              | ⏳ |
| api: webhook receivers  | Jubelio `webhook-signature` header (sha256 scheme)     | ⏳ |
| api: internal (web→api) | Shared bearer JWT (same `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`)             | ⏳ |
| api → web revalidate    | Shared `INTERNAL_API_KEY` (env, rotated quarterly)     | ⏳ |
| api: `/docs`            | HTTP Basic (`SWAGGER_USER`/`SWAGGER_PASS`) — disabled if env missing | ✅ |

- Permission constants live in `@elorae/types/erp/permissions` (⏳). Both services
  import them. No duplication.
- RBAC matrix in `apps/web/lib/rbac.ts` is the single source. api imports it
  via `@elorae/types` re-export (⏳).

**Current state:** apps/api routes are open to any caller on the network. Token
refresh and status endpoints are NOT gated. Acceptable for local-only dev; must
be closed before any public deploy.

## 6. Failure modes

| Failure          | Behaviour                                                                                          | State |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: |
| api down         | web ERP fully functional. `JubelioOutbox` accumulates. No data loss. Drains on api restart.        | ⏳ requires outbox |
| Jubelio down     | api outbox retries with backoff. UI shows "N items pending Jubelio sync" indicator.                | ⏳ requires outbox |
| web down         | api still ingests Jubelio webhooks and persists. Outbox idle (no producers).                       | ⏳ requires webhooks |
| DB down          | Both services 500. Standard.                                                                       | ✅ |
| Outbox stuck     | Alert when `PENDING + FAILED > threshold` for `> X min`. Manual replay tool in api admin.          | ⏳ |
| Webhook replay   | Dedup by `event_id` in `JubelioWebhookEvent`. Safe to replay.                                      | ⏳ |
| Token expired    | api auto-refreshes within 5 min of expiry (on demand). Single-flight refresh per process.          | ✅ on-demand; ⏳ proactive cron + alert on persistent failure |
| Schema drift     | Migrations run only via `@elorae/db`. CI blocks PRs that add migrations elsewhere.                 | 🟡 convention enforced socially; ⏳ CI guard |

---

## 7. Anti-patterns

- ❌ api importing from `apps/web/lib/*`. Circular dependency, blurs boundary.
  If logic must be shared, lift into `packages/types` or new `packages/*`.
- ❌ web calling Jubelio directly via `fetch('https://api2.jubelio.com')`.
- ❌ Two services running `prisma migrate`. Only `@elorae/db` runs migrations.
  Both apps run `prisma generate` only.
- ❌ Duplicating Zod schemas. Define once in `@elorae/types`.
- ❌ Writing to a table not listed in §3 without updating this doc first.
- ❌ Sync HTTP call from ERP server action to api inside a Prisma transaction.
  Always outbox.
- ❌ api writing to `User`, `Role`, `Permission`, `Item`, `GRN`, `PO`, or any
  table marked web-owned.

---

## 8. Monorepo migration — completion log

| # | Step | State |
| - | ---- | :---: |
| 1 | `git mv frontend apps/web` (drop `apps/web/prisma/` after step 2) | ✅ commits `01e2bb2`, `996d310` |
| 2 | Create `packages/db`; move `frontend/prisma/*` to `packages/db/prisma/` | ✅ `996d310` |
| 3 | Update `apps/web` imports of `@/lib/prisma` → `@elorae/db` (+ swap `@prisma/client` imports) | ✅ `996d310` |
| 4 | Remove `backend/` Go scaffold (throwaway) | ✅ `01e2bb2` |
| 5 | Wire NestJS at `apps/api` (hand-crafted, not `nest new`) — `PrismaModule`, `HealthModule`, `JubelioModule`, Swagger UI gated by Basic auth | ✅ `0758033`, `4d306da`, `a0526be` |
| 6 | `git mv jubelio reference/jubelio` (sample JSON + yaml + plans, gitignored) | ✅ `01e2bb2`, `885c8a0` |
| 7 | Add `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `turbo.json`, root `package.json` | ✅ `e34d26d` |
| 8 | CI: block migrations outside `@elorae/db`; lint forbidden imports (`apps/api` → `apps/web`) | ⏳ |

Additional bring-up: prisma generator swapped to ESM (`prisma-client`),
`bootstrap-env.ts` loads `.env` before `AppModule` resolves `@elorae/db`, dev
script uses `nest start --watch --builder swc` (SWC honours
`emitDecoratorMetadata` which tsx/esbuild do not).

## 9. Decisions

| # | Topic | Decision |
| - | ----- | -------- |
| Q1 | Webhook signature | Jubelio uses `sha256(JSON.stringify(payload) + SECRET_KEY)` — NOT strict HMAC. Header: `webhook-signature`. Secret configured in Jubelio dashboard (Pengaturan → Developer → Webhook). Rate limit: 600 req/min, 429 on exceed. Jubelio retries non-200 callbacks up to 3 times. |
| Q2 | Redis | **Upstash Redis** (managed). Free tier covers MVP. Used by BullMQ. |
| Q3 | api deployment | **Render** (persistent web service, Docker). |
| Q4 | Audit log writer | Shared helper in `@elorae/db` (e.g. `writeAuditLog()`). Single Prisma call site. Both services call it. |
| Q5 | `SystemSetting` namespace | api-owned keys prefixed `JUBELIO_*` (e.g. `JUBELIO_SESSION_TOKEN`). All other keys web-owned. Enforce in a small helper that rejects writes from the wrong owner. |
| D1 | Outbound queue | **BullMQ + Upstash Redis** (per Q2). All `apps/web` → `apps/api` async writes enqueued; `apps/api` workers drain. |
| D2 | Admin alert channel | TBD — pick before token polish ships (in-DB notification table / Slack webhook / Firebase push). |
| D3 | Admin dashboard | TBD — pick before outbox queue ships (JSON endpoints only vs full UI in apps/web). |
